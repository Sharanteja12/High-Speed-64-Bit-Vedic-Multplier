# High-Speed-64-Bit-Vedic-Multplier

A 64-bit multiplier is designed using the Urdhva Tiryakbhyam Sutra, one of the key techniques from Vedic mathematics, known for its efficiency in performing high-speed arithmetic operations.

By replacing the Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) with a Carry Save Adder (CSA), the maximum combinational delay is significantly reduced, as the CSA eliminates carry propagation, allowing faster parallel addition of multiple operands which indirectly improves the speed of the design.
